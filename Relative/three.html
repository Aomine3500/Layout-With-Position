    <!--A relative positioned element is an element whose computed position property 
        is relative to itself. 
        The space the element formally held in the DOM is still blocked out. -->

    <!--an element’s original position remains in the flow of the document,
        just like the static value. But now left/right/top/bottom/z-index 
        will work. The positional properties “nudge” the element from 
        the original position in that direction. -->
