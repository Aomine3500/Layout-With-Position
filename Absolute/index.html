    <!--An absolute positioned element is removed from the normal flow of the DOM. 
        An absolute positioned element is an element whose computed position property
        is calculated from the next element up the DOM which has a position property
        or the html element if nothing up the DOM has a position property.-->

    <!--the element is removed from the flow of the document and other elements 
        will behave as if itâ€™s not even there whilst all the other positional 
        properties will work on it.
